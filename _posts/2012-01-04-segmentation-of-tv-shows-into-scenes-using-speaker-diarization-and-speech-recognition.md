This is a paper to be presented at [the 37th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)](http://www.icassp2012.org/) in Kyoto, Japan (March 25 - 30, 2012)

We investigate the use of speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the segmentation of audiovisual documents into scenes. We introduce multiple monomodal and multimodal approaches based on a state-of-the-art algorithm called generalized scene transition graph (GSTG). First, we extend the latter with the use of semantic information derived from both SD and ASR. Then, multimodal fusion of color histograms, SD and ASR is investigated at various point of the GSTG pipeline (early, late or intermediate fusion). Experiments driven on a few episodes of a popular TV show indicate that SD and ASR can be successfully combined with visual information and bring an additional +11% relative increase in terms of F-Measure for scene boundary detection over the state-of-the-art baseline.
